# Escape-Room-AR

A Unity/C# game using ARFoundation.

IDEA
The idea was to implement an escape room using Augmented Reality technology on an Android device.
The user would place the necessary objects around a chosen room, and then figure out the puzzle.

GAMEPLAY
A sample gameplay is in a file called "gameplay_Trim.mp4"
It's not much, but it's honest work
